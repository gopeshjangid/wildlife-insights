          <h2>1. Processing of Personal Information</h2>
          <h3>A. What Personal Information do we collect?</h3>
          <p>
            Personal information means any information about a living individual from which that
            individual can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been
            removed (anonymous data). All personally identifiable information about you is referred
            to in this Privacy Policy as “<u>Personal Information</u>”. If you wish to use the
            Service, you must register and, in doing so, provide Personal Information about
            yourself. This may include your name, email address, location, age, username, password
            and password recovery identification information selected by you.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will also collect information about the computer or device you use to access the
            Service, including location data such as GPS data and mapped WiFi access points, IP
            addresses, browsers or hardware or software types and versions, and use such data to
            provide and personalize the Service to you. Additionally, we may collect, process and
            use your computer or device content, metadata and connection data as necessary to
            provide the Service to you, to detect, contain and rectify errors or faults on your
            computer, device or communication network or to discover, investigate or prevent fraud
            or criminality.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may use and process your Personal Information only as described in this Privacy
            Policy.
          </p>
          <h3>B. What do we do with your Personal Information?</h3>
          <p>
            We will use your Personal Information to provide the Service to you, including
            personalization of the Service for you, and to communicate with you. We will make your
            name and email address available to other Users to facilitate communication among Users.
            We will share your Personal Information in other manners or with other parties only as
            set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may combine your Personal Information with other
            information and use such information in combined form, but in all cases only as
            described in this Privacy Policy. If we wish to share your Personal Information with
            others for any other reason or in any manner not authorized under this Privacy Policy,
            we will first request and obtain your separate consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will use your Personal Information as described above on lawful bases, including for
            the legitimate purposes outlined above, and on the basis of your consent, which you have
            provided us by registering on the Service. Our processing of your Personal Information
            as described does not outweigh your rights and freedoms and you have the right at any
            time to withdraw your consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            As described in the Terms of Use, we may use third-party service providers, such as
            hosting services or information processors, to help us operate the Service. WI Members
            are eligible to serve in that capacity. In the case of all such service providers, we
            will require the provider to agree to adhere to this Privacy Policy regarding any
            Personal Information it obtains from you. The service provider will be authorized to use
            your Personal Information only for the limited purpose of the services provided by it to
            us. In addition, if CI delegates any Service operations to another WI Member as
            described in the Terms of Use, the foregoing restrictions will apply as well. We will
            not provide your Personal Information to any WI Member solely because of its identity as
            a WI Member.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may disclose your Personal Information as required by law, such as to comply with a
            subpoena or other judicial, legislative or administrative process, in response to a
            government request for information or if we believe that disclosure is necessary or
            appropriate to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, protect
            our operations or security or investigate or report fraud or criminality relating to CI
            or to the Service or its mission. In the event of a merger, acquisition or sale of all
            or a portion of CI or the Service or the replacement of CI as the operator of the
            Service on behalf of the WI Core Members, we may transfer Personal Information to the
            successor organization, in which case we will announce the event on the Service, as well
            as describe any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information. We will not
            give or sell your email address to any persons or entities other than as described in
            this Privacy Policy, although we may use your email address to communicate with you
            ourselves.
          </p>
          <h3>
            C. Do we use cookies or other technologies in connection with Personal Information?
          </h3>
          <p>
            We will place our “cookies” on your device to digitally personalize your Service use.
            Cookies track your preferences, login credentials and traffic and browsing patterns, and
            may be permanent or temporary. We may also use other technologies (e.g. web beacons) to
            track your use of the Service. We will not share any Personal Information we obtain via
            cookies other than as described in this Privacy Policy. You are not required to accept
            our cookies, and you can change your computer, device or browser settings to disable
            them, but functionality of the Service may be limited if you do not accept our cookies.
          </p>
          <h3>D. Does the Service contain advertising?</h3>
          <p>
            The Service is not an advertising-based service. However, the Service may display the
            names, logos, linked URLs and announcements of CI, WI, the WI Members and other
            organizations involved in or supporting the development or maintenance of the Service.
            No Personal Information will be collected from you on the Service by any organization
            other than CI, and no information of yours will be given to any of such organizations by
            CI, except as described in this Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <h2>2. Processing of Non-Personal Information</h2>
          <h3>A. What non-personal information does the Service collect?</h3>
          <p>
            We collect all of the wildlife monitoring and other data that you submit or make
            available to the Service during your use of the Service but that is not Personal
            Information, including the specific pages, features or Content you access within the
            Service, the length of time you use specific Service features and the third-party web
            pages or applications from which you are referred to the Service (collectively, “
            <u>Non-Personal Information</u>”).
          </p>
          <h3>B. What do we do with your Non-Personal Information?</h3>
          <p>
            We may process, reproduce, translate and otherwise use your Non-Personal Information for
            the purpose of administering the Service, providing the Service to you, customizing your
            Service use experience, analyzing the use of the Service, maintaining the security of
            the Service and improving or updating the Service. We may combine your Non-Personal
            Information with other information and use such information in combined form, but in all
            cases only as described in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. In addition, as
            authorized under the Terms of Use, we may use your Non-Personal Information, alone or
            with third-party sublicensees, to develop or improve computer vision models for the
            purpose of advancing technology related to conservation, including training relating to
            the use of such models. In the case of such uses with a third-party sublicensee, the
            sublicensee will be authorized to use your information only for such purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can access certain limited portions of the Service without registering and providing
            Personal Information, but you cannot use the Service’s data sharing platform without
            registering. If you use portions of the Service without registering, we may still
            collect web browsing information, which is not assigned to a specific individual. We use
            web browsing information for technical administration in an anonymized form to
            administer and improve the Service, analyze trends and maintain the security of the
            Service.
          </p>
          <h3>C. Do we perform web site and other analytics within the Service?</h3>
          <p>
            We may perform analytics regarding the use of the Service, to improve the performance of
            the Service and to troubleshoot problems. If we perform such analytics through the use
            of third-party sublicensees (e.g. Google Analytics), the sublicensee will be authorized
            to use your information only for such purpose.
          </p>
          <h2>3. Management and Protection of Information</h2>
          <h3>A. How do we protect Personal Information?</h3>
          <p>
            We maintain appropriate and reasonable administrative, physical, and technical measures
            to protect your Personal Information. We restrict access to only those persons who need
            to know the Personal Information in question to provide the Service to you and any other
            persons that you have authorized to have access to your Personal Information. We use
            Secure Sockets Layer (“<u>SSL</u>”) encryption on all Service web pages where Personal
            Information is collected. You must use an SSL- enabled browser (e.g. Internet Explorer,
            Safari, Firefox or Chrome) or device to submit Personal Information to the Service or to
            CI via the web. If you transmit information to CI via email, please remember that
            communications sent by email are normally not encrypted. So, if you wish to reduce
            transmission risk, we recommend that you communicate to CI via the Service or via
            another encrypted method. We cannot promise that your communications with CI or the
            Service will not be intercepted by others. You agree that we are not liable for damages
            to you from any loss of privacy occurring in such communications.
          </p>
          <p>
            The internet is a global environment. By using the Service, you consent to trans- border
            and international transmissions of your Personal Information to servers located anywhere
            in the world, including but not limited to the United States.
          </p>
          <h3>B. What about third-party postings and links?</h3>
          <p>
            As authorized under the Terms of Use, CI may post Content you submit to the Service to
            social media accounts for the Service. Your Personal Information will not be posted by
            CI to social media accounts for the Service. If other Content you submit to the Service
            is posted by CI to social media accounts for the Service, the use of such Content
            thereon will be governed by the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the respective
            social media platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Service may include links to, or may interact with, third-party web sites or services. Any such links or interactions are provided only as a convenience and do not imply endorsement of such sites or services. Please read the terms, conditions, privacy policies and license agreements of such third-party web sites and services. CI is not responsible for the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties operating web sites or services to which the Service links or with which the Service interacts. If CI is itself the owner or operator of any such web site or service in its individual capacity (as opposed to in its capacity as a WI Core Member), then CI is responsible for such privacy, information and other practices solely in its individual capacity.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are responsible for any Personal Information, Non-Personal Information, content,
            data or other information that you post outside the Service.
          </p>
          <h3>C. What is our policy concerning minors?</h3>
          <p>
            As described in the Terms of Use, the Service is intended for use by individuals age 13 or over.  We do not solicit or knowingly collect information from Users under age 13. By using the Service, you represent that you are at least 13 years old and, if you are under the age of majority where you live, your use is supervised by a parent or legal guardian.
          </p>
          <h3>D. How long do we retain information?</h3>
          <p>
            We delete your Personal Information and Non-Personal Information as soon as the
            information is no longer necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected,
            unless we retain the information to comply with applicable law or retain a copy of the
            information following disclosure of it as permitted under Section 1(B) hereof. Except
            for Personal Information we retain for the foregoing reasons, we will delete your
            Personal Information upon your request made on our “Contact Us” page at{' '}

          <h2>4. Do not track Signals</h2>

            Information to third parties for direct marketing by or on behalf of such third parties.
