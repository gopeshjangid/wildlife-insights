Your representations under Section 6(A)(1) include a representation that you have the right to authorize CI to use Your Data as described in clauses 6(B)(1)-(7) above.

                  information as described below (“<u>Sensitive Data</u>”), CI may withhold such
                  Data from general publication on the Service. CV-based image identification may be
                  available on the Service to attempt to identify Sensitive Data, but it is your
                  responsibility to confirm, correct or add to any such CV identification prior to

                  <u>Humans.</u> Still, video and other images of humans within Recorded Data is
                  considered Sensitive Data. CI will not knowingly make such images of humans within
                  Recorded Data public on the Service. You may store, analyze and grant specific
                  access to another User to such images of humans on non-public segments of the
                  Service if the human faces therein are obfuscated. CI may attempt to obfuscate
                  human faces in such images but it is not obligated to do so, and it is your
                  responsibility to confirm, correct or add to the results of any such CI effort
                  using the Service’s editing tools prior to the point at which any other User is
                  granted access to the image on the Service. You may also have a right to have
                  images of humans within your Recorded Data deleted from the Service under Section

                  <u>At-Risk Species.</u> Geographic location data in Recorded Data and Metadata
                  relating to certain at-risk species is considered Sensitive Data. A list of such
                  species, as designated by CI and updated from time to time, is found at{' '}

                  . For the protection of such species, CI will deploy tools in an effort to strip
                  or obscure such location data in Recorded Data, and to obscure such location data
                  in Metadata, prior to making the applicable Recorded Data or Metadata available
                  for public view on the Service. If geographic location data relating to such
                  species is found in any Recorded Data or Metadata, the geographic location data
                  relating to such species may be stripped or obscured in this manner from all
                  Recorded Data and Metadata in the same Deployment (including Recorded Data and
                  Metadata in such Deployment that came from Users other than the one in which such
                  geographic location data was found). You must provide the Service with all true
                  geographic location data, however, prior to any such stripping or obscuring by CI.
                  The Data, as so adjusted, will be made available publicly on the Service, but
                  Recorded Data will be associated only with its Project and not with any geographic
                  location data. You may also request additional at-risk species to have geographic
                  location data stripped or obscured from Your Data on the Service in the foregoing
                  manner, which request CI may grant or deny in our discretion.

If you choose an embargo of a Project, the Recorded Data, Deployment Metadata and Identification Metadata in such Project (collectively “Embargoed Data”) will not be available to other Users on the Service except as described in this Section 6(D). You may not embargo Project Metadata, as any embargo you choose of a Project will not apply to the Project Metadata therein.

                  <u>Embargo Period.</u> The Embargo Period may not exceed 24 months. The Embargo
                  Period is measured separately for each Deployment in a Project, beginning on the
                  date the applicable Deployment is entered into the Service and ending on the date
                  the designated Embargo Period for such Deployment has passed. Such end date is the

                  Administrator who will be assigned control of Your Data under these Terms of Use,
                  but if you fail to make such appointment within the time allotted by CI, CI may
                  appoint any other User affiliated with your Organization on the Service, in our
                  discretion. If you are the sole User affiliated with the Organization, control of
